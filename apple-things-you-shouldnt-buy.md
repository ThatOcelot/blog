# Apple Things You Probably Shouldn't Buy

### 13" MacBook Pro

![Terrible value](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/mbp-silver-select-202011_GEO_US?wid=1280&hei=1190&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80&.v=1632950226000)

The 13" MacBook Pro provides a terrible value, considering that it has the same procesor as the M1 MacBook Air and costs $300 more.

#### What you should get instead

Most people will be just fine with the M1 MacBook Air. If you need a bit more power, you should purchase the 14" MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro or M1 Max processor.

### iPod touch

![The iPod still exists](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/ipod-touch-select-blue-2019_GEO_US_FMT_WHH?wid=940&hei=1112&fmt=png-alpha&.v=1558124595488)

The iPod touch still exists.

#### What you should get instead

The iPhone SE is a fully featured iPhone that only costs $430. Sure, it's not as cheap as the iPod touch's $200, but the iPhone SE has basically all of the features of the other iPhones.

### Apple Watch Series 3

![Ye olde Apple Watch](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/42-alu-space-sport-black-nc-gallery1?wid=2000&hei=2000&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80&.v=1594259752000)

The Apple Watch Series 3 is old and Apple refuses to get rid of it.

#### What you should get instead

The Apple Watch SE only costs $80 more than the Series 3 and is a lot newer and doesn't require you to reset the watch in order to update it.

### 21.5" iMac

![iCrap](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/refurb-2017-imac-215-gallery?wid=1144&hei=1144&fmt=jpeg&qlt=80&.v=1499114976977)

The 21.5" iMac can be found in Apple's refurbished store for $890. However, it is a very outdated computer.

#### What you should get instead

The Mac mini is infinitely better and costs $700. If you buy peripherals at a thrift store, you should be able to pay around $800. However, if you have peripherals at home, you can use those as well.

### Apple TV HD

![Apple TV Old](https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/as-images.apple.com/is/apple-tv-hd-hero-select-202104_FMT_WHH?wid=940&hei=1112&fmt=p-jpg&qlt=95&.v=1618010696000)

The Apple TV HD is another old product that Apple refuses to replace.

#### What you should get instead

The Apple TV 4K costs only $30 more and it's 4K compatible, so even if you don't have a 4K TV (I don't), you are still 4K ready if you decide to upgrade,
