# My Smartphone Saga
I think that a good way to see how technology has evolved is to see what smartphones people have had over time. So, I decided to share my short (but also long) history of smartphone ownership.
## iPhone 6s
My first smartphone was an old iPhone 6s that I got in sixth grade after repairing it. The only notable thing about that phone was that it had absolutely terrible battery life.
## iPhone 8
To replace it, I got an iPhone 8. Honestly, it was kind of boring. Moving on.
## OnePlus 6T
This has to be my most interesting mobile experience. I bought it expecting it to be a bit smaller than it actually was. I've had this for three years. I took it to Russia. I got stuck at the airport in Germany with it. All of that nice stuff. When I got my next phone, I decided to dedicate this phone to mess around and use it as a second phone. However, after installing Ubuntu Touch and then letting it sit, it's practically bricked.
## iPhone 13
My newest phone is pretty good. It's my first 5G phone, so that's fun, I guess. Well, there's more stuff to do with this.
