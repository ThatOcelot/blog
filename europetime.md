# How the Nazis made most of Europe fall under one time zone.
When you look at any large landmass, you can see different time zones seperating it. The USA has six time zones (eleven if you also count territories), Russia has eleven, Africa (as a continent) as six, and Australia has three. There are, however, three large regions that are made of mostly a singular time zone. The first two are China (which uses UTC+08:00) and India (which uses UTC+05:30). The third is, weirdly, Europe which uses UTC+01:00 as far west as Spain and as far east as Poland.
Many places within CET are geographically located in other time zones. Spain, Morocco, Western Sahara, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Gibraltar are territories that fall entirely outside of UTC+10:00, while most of France and Algeria are geographically located in UTC+00:00. In addition, parts of Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, North Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Norway are using UTC+01:00 in other geographical time zones.
