# An analysis of *Hine Ani Ba*
## Some context
In 2008, Columbia Pictures released Adam Sandler's action black comedy *You Don't Mess with the Zohan*. The film attracted me because I am a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's 2006 mockumentary black comedy *Borat: Cultural Learning of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation Kazakhstan* and his 2012 black comedy *The Dictator*.
*Zohan* introduced me to many Israeli pop songs, such as *Hine Ani Ba*.
In this blog post, you will see the term Cisjordan. Cisjordan is a term used for the area between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. The term most likely fell out of fashion after the Hasemite Kingdom of Transjordan annexed the region known today as the West Bank and changed its name to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. I am using Cisjordan in a geographical sense. Israeli and Palestinian will be used to refer to Jews and Arabs living in Cisjordan, respectively.
## The analysis
"Hine ani ba" is repeated seven times by the singer and means "Here I come".
"Yerushalayim, ir shava pitsuts" literally means "Jerusalem, a city worthy of explosion" though "worhty of explosion" is (ironically, given Cisjordan's history with terrorism) a slang term used by Israelis equivalent to "helluva". Israelis and Palestinians both consider Jerusalem as their nation's capital, given that Jerusalem is the holiest city in Judaism and Christianity and the third holiest city in Islam.
"Holekh bamidrakhov margish kmo kibuts galuyot elef tarbuyot, lekol ekhad yesh akh vetesha akhayot" refers to the city's diversity.
"Aravim beseder kharedim bekheder" specifically points out the Arab and Ultra-Orthodox communities of Jerusalem saying that the Arabs are okay and the Ultra-Orthodox are in a cheder (a Jewish religious school).
"Vekulam po koltim et elohim beteder" refers to the city's holiness in Abrahamic religions.
"Akharei tedi yerushalayim da'akha maher" refers to Teddy Stadium in Jerusalem. Sports fans, especially soccer fans, will notably travel to foreign countries to watch their team play in person (see Baron Cohen's 2016 action comedy *The Brothers Grimsby*). After the game is over, they will leave and often leave everything in shambles.
"Meyom leyom tel aviv natsetsa yoter" shows that the singer sees Tel Aviv as calling to him.
"Khaverim azvu o hitkarvu lebore shamayim" shows that all of the singer's friends either left Jerusalem or became more religious (a phenomenon often known as Jerusalem syndrome).
